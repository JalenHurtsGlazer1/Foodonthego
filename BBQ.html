      <h1>Ribs</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Ribs are considered an American delicacy because they are deeply tied to the country’s barbecue traditions and regional cultures, especially in the South and Midwest. Slow-cooked and seasoned with rich rubs or sauces, ribs are known for their tender texture and bold, smoky flavor that reflect generations of cooking techniques passed down over time. They are often served at gatherings, cookouts, and celebrations, making them a symbol of togetherness and comfort food in American culture. People should eat ribs not only for their satisfying taste but also for the experience they offer—enjoying ribs is as much about tradition and community as it is about the food itself.

<h1>Dan's Thoughts</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-black"> <h6>“When I think about Barbeque in the backyard, I think about Ribs. They are like a fourth down conversion, can’t go wrong with them.. Ribs are the number 1 barbeque food item in my opinion, so everyone should go out and try them. They're perfect for tailgating for your favorite NFL team before some Sunday football.”</h6> </p> <img src="Dan capbmy.jpg" alt="">

      <h1>Burgers</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Burgers are so good because they bring together comforting flavors and textures in one simple meal: a juicy patty, a soft bun, and toppings that can be customized to anyone’s taste. Whether it’s cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, or sauces, each bite feels satisfying and familiar, which is why burgers are often linked to good memories with friends and family. They’re also versatile—people can make them classic, spicy, vegetarian, or packed with veggies—so almost everyone can enjoy one their own way. When eaten in moderation as part of a balanced diet, burgers can be a fun, filling, and enjoyable food that brings people together and makes meals feel a little more special.</h5> <img src="burger.webp" width="350" alt="">

      <h1>Dan's Thoughts</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-black"></p> <h6> "Burgers are an american classic. You can never go wrong with a burger while you're watching your favorite team dominate. The nice thing is that burgers aren't plain. You can put just about anything you want on them, so you'll never run out of different combinations. This is one of my personal favorites."</h6> <img src="Dan 2.0.jpg" alt="">
